# Security Documentation

## Overview

This document outlines the security measures implemented in the Sentiri Platform to protect user data, prevent unauthorized access, and ensure compliance with security best practices.

## üîê Authentication & Authorization

### Multi-Factor Authentication
- **Email Verification**: Required for all new accounts
- **Password Strength**: Enforced with real-time validation
- **Session Management**: Secure session handling with automatic timeout

### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- **Admin**: Full system access, user management, company settings
- **Manager**: Project management, team oversight, reporting
- **User**: Basic operations, data entry, viewing permissions

### Protected Routes
- All application routes require authentication
- Automatic redirect to login for unauthenticated users
- Role-based component access using `RoleGuard` components

## üõ°Ô∏è Database Security

### Row Level Security (RLS)
All database tables have RLS policies that ensure:
- Users can only access data from their own company
- Company isolation prevents cross-company data access
- Secure signup process with temporary policy exceptions

### Audit Logging
- All data modifications are logged
- User actions tracked for security monitoring
- Audit trail for compliance and incident response

### Data Validation
- Input sanitization prevents SQL injection
- Type checking and format validation
- Rate limiting on database operations

## üîí Input Validation & Sanitization

### Client-Side Validation
- Real-time form validation
- Password strength indicators
- Input sanitization before submission

### Server-Side Validation
- Comprehensive validation on all API endpoints
- Sanitization of all user inputs
- Protection against XSS and injection attacks

### File Upload Security
- File type validation
- Size limits (5MB maximum)
- Secure filename generation
- Virus scanning integration ready

## üåê Network Security

### Content Security Policy (CSP)
```javascript
{
  'default-src': ["'self'"],
  'script-src': ["'self'", "'unsafe-inline'", "'unsafe-eval'"],
  'style-src': ["'self'", "'unsafe-inline'", "https://fonts.googleapis.com"],
  'connect-src': ["'self'", "https://*.supabase.co", "https://api.anthropic.com"],
  'frame-src': ["'none'"],
  'object-src': ["'none'"]
}
```

### Security Headers
- `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`
- `X-Frame-Options: DENY`
- `X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block`
- `Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000`
- `Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin`

### HTTPS Enforcement
- All connections use HTTPS
- HSTS headers prevent downgrade attacks
- Secure cookie settings

## üìä Security Monitoring

## üîê Password Security

### Password Requirements
- Minimum 8 characters
- Must include uppercase, lowercase, numbers
- Special characters recommended
- No common patterns allowed

### Password Strength Scoring
- Real-time strength assessment
- Visual feedback to users
- Progressive strength indicators
- Secure password generation

### Password Storage
- Hashed using bcrypt
- Salted for additional security
- No plain text storage
- Secure reset procedures

## üö´ Rate Limiting

### API Rate Limits
- 10 requests per minute per user
- 100 requests per hour per user
- Automatic blocking of excessive requests
- Graceful degradation under load

### Authentication Rate Limits
- 5 failed login attempts per 15 minutes
- 3 password reset attempts per hour
- Account lockout after repeated failures
- Automatic unlock after timeout

## üì± Session Security

### Session Management
- Secure session tokens
- Automatic timeout after 30 minutes
- Session invalidation on logout
- Concurrent session limits

### Session Storage
- Secure HTTP-only cookies
- SameSite attribute enforcement
- CSRF protection
- Secure token generation

## üîç Data Protection

### Data Encryption
- Data encrypted in transit (TLS 1.3)
- Data encrypted at rest
- Sensitive data obfuscation
- Secure key management

### Privacy Compliance
- GDPR compliance measures
- Data minimization principles
- User consent management
- Right to be forgotten implementation

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Security

### Code Security
- Input validation on all forms
- Output encoding to prevent XSS
- Secure coding practices
- Regular security audits

### Dependency Security
- Regular dependency updates
- Vulnerability scanning
- License compliance
- Security patch management

### Environment Security
